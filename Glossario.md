<strong>RFCs: </strong> Requests for Comments, started out as general requests for comments (hence the name) to resolve network
and protocol design problems that faced the precursor to the Internet [Allman 2011]. RFCs tend to be quite technical and detailed. They define protocols such as TCP, IP,
HTTP (for the Web), and SMTP (for e-mail). There are currently more than 6,000 RFCs. Other bodies also specify standards for network components, most notably for network links. The IEEE 802 LAN/MAN Standards Committee [IEEE 802 2012], for example, specifies the Ethernet and wireless WiFi standards.
